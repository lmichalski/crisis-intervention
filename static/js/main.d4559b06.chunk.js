Suicide risk is common among individuals with underlying mental health disorders, and individuals experiencing crisis situations may feel unequipped to deal with life stressors (WHO, 2019). With the increase occurrences of suicide, health care providers often utilize a suicide risk assessment (SRA) into their practice which provides a guideline on how to support at-risk clients. SRA are helpful to identify factors that may increase or decrease a patient\u2019s level of suicide risk, to estimate an overall level of risk, and to develop a care plan that addresses their safety and modifiable contributors to suicide risk (Jacobs et al., 2010). The SRA has a continuous process which involves four essential principles. These principles include the therapeutic relationship, communication and collaboration, documentation in the assessment process, and cultural awareness. Establishing a therapeutic rapport can improve the SRA process, and communication is critical to ensure SRA remains consistent. Organizing clear notes can help plan for treatments and preventative care, as well as acknowledging culture as a potential influence on suicide (Perlman et al., 2011).

Step two \u2013identify risk factors, noting those that can be modified to reduce risk. This step has the potential to seek risk factors based on the information received from the patient and collateral sources such as family (Sadek, 2018). Lastly, step three \u2013 formulating risk. Make a clinical judgement of the risk that a client may attempt or complete suicide in the short or long term.

According to the WHO (2019), suicide is one of the top 10 causes of death, and the second leading cause of death in people aged 15\u201329 years (Sadek, 2018). This illustrates the extreme need for accurate assessment by health care professionals. In addition, suicide does not only affect the individual who loses their life, but also deeply effects peers, friends, family members, coworkers, and overall communities (CPSI et al., 2021). Suicide often profoundly affects at least 15 people aside from the individual who has passed away (CPSI et al., 2021). Besides the long-lasting emotional effects left on these other parties, there are also large expenses associated with suicide. A mental health commission report in 2016 explained that the estimated financial cost of a suicide ranges from $433,000 to $4,131,000 per individual, depending on potential years of life lost, income level, and effects on survivors (Sadek, 2018)."," "]}),Object(p.jsxs)("p",{children:["Health care professionals, especially mental health care providers, have the task of supporting individuals through times of poor mental wellness, as well as maintaining positive mental health.
