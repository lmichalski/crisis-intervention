Kelly relocated to Toronto, Ontario in the Fall to pursue her first year of the bachelor\u2019s degree in environmental studies. Prior to relocating, Kelly grew up in a rural community with her parents and two younger siblings. Both her parents are second generation farmers, and regularly attend weekly mass at a local church. Kelly\u2019s upbringing on the farm encouraged her to be a strong advocate for sustainable living and environmental protection. Kelly decided to pursue her passion in environmental studies. Initially, Kelly\u2019s parents were disappointed but agreed to financially and emotionally support her decision.","Shortly before the commencement of the first semester, Talia was assigned to be Kelly\u2019s roommate on campus. Kelly and Talia were instantly able to form a strong connection as they were both enrolled in the same program and had similar passions. Towards the end of the Fall semester, Talia noticed that Kelly became distant, less communicative and had difficulty getting out of bed. Talia also notes that Kelly was coming home late from parties, was frequently intoxicated and would often miss classes. During exams, Kelly was very anxious and attempted to suicide by mixing over the counter medication and alcohol. Talia suggested that Kelly attend the Drop-In Wellness Centre at school. Kelly agreed and received support from Marcus, a counsellor, at the Wellness Centre. Kelly only attended one session but reported she was feeling much better.","Due to financial restrictions, Kelly was unable to return home during the Winter holidays and stayed on-campus. Talia felt comfortable leaving Kelly alone as she had reporting she was feeling better and returned to her hometown for the holidays. When Talia returned from her holiday vacation, she noticed that Kelly looked unkept, lost a lot of weight, and their dorm was filled with alcohol bottles. Kelly reported she failed most of her classes last semester and was not doing well emotionally. Talia suggested that Kelly go to the Wellness Centre. Initially Kelly resists the idea of seeking professional help again, but after seeing the concern from Talia and some discussion Kelly agrees to make an appointment to see Marcus. Talia decided to accompany Kelly to her appointment."]},"objectives":{"paragraph1":"This virtual gaming simulation is focused on using the best practices for working with a suicidal client.","paragraph2":"By the end of this module, you will be able to:","bullet_list":["Apply best practices to assess the risk of suicide.","Select the best evidence-based techniques and skills needed to work with a suicidal client.","Evaluate the appropriate methods of action to ensure client safety."]},"instructions":{"paragraph":"Watch the video story unfold.

Lastly, step three \u2013 formulating risk: make a clinical judgement of the risk that a patient/client may attempt or complete suicide in the short or long term.

Prior to choosing a tool, it is significant to acknowledge the sole purpose of an effective SRA. It is strongly recommended SRA tools to not be used as a way to predict suicide. Rather it helps assess and reduce the risk of suicide, inform treatment planning, and to promote wellness and recovery through the gathering of information (CPSI et al., 2021).

Technical considerations include: correlation, reliability, validity, sensitivity, specificity, factor analysis, threshold scores, modes of administration (Perlman et al., 2011).

Risk assessment gathers history of several aspects of an individual\u2019s life, but steers away from demographic characteristics. Current history collected include risk factors, clinical mental health status examinations, and collateral sources such as violence towards self or others (Sadek, 2018). It is critical specific tools are made available to different cultures to fit their particular needs. These tools may not only understand different cultures views on health or wellness, but may recognize that these different cultures views may influence motives of suicide related risk or behaviours (CPSI et al., 2021).

Examples of older tools could be the Manchester Self-harm Rule and the Repeated Episodes of Self-harm score, which used more methodology and are often not strong enough to make a clinical decision as they are too based in numerical results.

However, there are also many possible drawbacks related to SRA\u2019s. Starting at the base level; the beginning, there is the training that mental health care providers receive regarding crisis and suicide supports or assessments. SRA\u2019s require training and the understanding that assessment is an ongoing process where the risks may change over time (Sadek, 2018). There is sudden concern because health care providers do not receive enough crisis training and often feel fear and a lack of confidence (Roush et al., 2018).

This can be minorly avoided if a health care provider can get a more complete picture by collecting collateral information about the service user (Sadek, 2018). It is tricky to find the perfect practices because tool guidelines are not all the same in their recommendations and there are no universally accepted models (Oquendo & Bernanke, 2017).
