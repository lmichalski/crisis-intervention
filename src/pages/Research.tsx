            <p>
              According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2019),
              approximately 800,000 people die every year due to suicide.
              Suicide risk is common among individuals with underlying mental
              health disorders, and individuals experiencing crisis situations
              may feel unequipped to deal with life stressors (WHO, 2019). With
              the increase occurrences of suicide, health care providers often
              utilize a suicide risk assessment (SRA) into their practice which
              provides a guideline on how to support at-risk clients. SRA are
              helpful to identify factors that may increase or decrease a
              patient’s level of suicide risk, to estimate an overall level of
              risk, and to develop a care plan that addresses their safety and
              modifiable contributors to suicide risk (Jacobs et al., 2010). The
              SRA has a continuous process which involves four essential
              principles. These principles include the therapeutic relationship,
              communication and collaboration, documentation in the assessment
              process, and cultural awareness. Establishing a therapeutic
              rapport can improve the SRA process, and communication is critical
              to ensure SRA remains consistent. Organizing clear notes can help
              plan for treatments and preventative care, as well as
              acknowledging culture as a potential influence on suicide (Perlman
              et al., 2011). Altogether these principles guide the assessment
              process.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              Sadek (2018) also identifies similar steps. Step one – building a
              therapeutic relationship and alliance with the clients and asking
              about suicidal ideation. As previously mentioned, creating a
              therapeutic alliance is an essential foundation for SRA which
              involves empathy, support, and transparency (Sadek, 2018). Step
              two –identify risk factors, noting those that can be modified to
              reduce risk. This step has the potential to seek risk factors
              based on the information received from the patient and collateral
              sources such as family (Sadek, 2018). Lastly, step three –
              formulating risk. Make a clinical judgement of the risk that a
              client may attempt or complete suicide in the short or long term.
              During this step, clinical formulation of risk is considered such
              as a low acute risk, or high chronic risk (Sadek, 2018).
              Collectively, the three steps reflect on the amount of work put
              into the SRA process.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              SRA is primarily conducted in a health care setting. However, this
              assessment should only be conducted if it is a first psychiatric
              admission, and/or the individual is exhibiting suicidal
              behaviour/ideation (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 2011).
              Conducting an SRA can be a complex process and requires extensive
              knowledge and practice before implementing it into practice. This
              literature seeks to identify the significance of SRA, current SRAs
              in practice, commonly used SRA tools, how to choose an effective
              SRA tool, the different views on SRA, and the SRA benefits and
              drawbacks.{" "}
            </p>

            <h2>Significance of the Suicide Risk Assessment</h2>
            <p>
              SRAs are useful tools for service providers and of particular
              importance to crisis intervention. SRAs are internationally
              recognized as a useful safety measure among health care
              organizations and adopted into clinical settings (Perlman et al.,
              2011). Throughout Canada, suicide is the ninth leading cause of
              death across all ages, with a rate of 10.3 deaths per 100,000
              people (Sadek, 2020). According to the WHO (2019), suicide is one
              of the top 10 causes of death, and the second leading cause of
              death in people aged 15–29 years (Sadek, 2018). This illustrates
              the extreme need for accurate assessment by health care
              professionals. In addition, suicide does not only affect the
              individual who loses their life, but also deeply effects peers,
              friends, family members, coworkers, and overall communities (CPSI
              et al., 2021). Suicide often profoundly affects at least 15 people
              aside from the individual who has passed away (CPSI et al., 2021).
              Besides the long-lasting emotional effects left on these other
              parties, there are also large expenses associated with suicide. A
              mental health commission report in 2016 explained that the
              estimated financial cost of a suicide ranges from $433,000 to
              $4,131,000 per individual, depending on potential years of life
              lost, income level, and effects on survivors (Sadek, 2018).{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              Health care professionals, especially mental health care
              providers, have the task of supporting individuals through times
              of poor mental wellness, as well as maintaining positive mental
              health. Roush et al. (2018) maintains that individuals who lose
              their life from suicide have had contact with a mental health
              professional within one month prior to passing, approximately 20%
              of the time. These professionals are in a key position where they
              can appropriately assess suicide risk and make potentially
              life-saving decisions regarding SRA and management, often through
              using SRA tools (Roush et al., 2018). There are often several
              measures that can be taken to assist in reducing the risk of
              suicide and suicide attempts (CPSI et al., 2021), and the
              assessment and management of suicide risk is considered a core
              competency for psychiatrists (Oquendo & Bernanke, 2017).{" "}
            </p>

            <h2>Current SRA in Crisis Intervention</h2>
            <p>
              Recent literature describes SRA as an ongoing process that
              involves various tools. SRA tools are significant to the
              assessment process, as they can provide additional information to
              inform clinical decision-making involving suicide and crisis
              intervention (CPSI et al., 2021). Typically, the guidelines for
              SRA are standardized in psychiatric facilities. Following the
              process of screening, monitoring, intervention, and follow-up to
              continuously inform initial care and progress in treatment, or
              potential changes to the level of care required (Perlman et al.,
              2011). Prior to conducting an SRA, most professionals studied the
              process, but focusing on clinical experience is also an asset.
              Perlman et al. (2011) recommends professionals understand the
              different SRA tools to help navigate the process best. Two studies
              by Sadek (2018) and Sadek et al. (2020) can agree that clinician
              awareness and training should be required to assess for suicide
              risk, as clinical competency is essential for patient care.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although a substantial amount of research points out the
              inadequacy of the SRA tools implemented into practice, the highest
              concern being the lack of education and training health care
              professionals receive about the SRA process (Sadek, 2018). The
              complexity of an SRA can reflect on the quality of care. It is
              essential changes are made to improve the SRA process, to
              effectively document and assist an individual at risk of suicide.
              Perlman at al. (2011) outlines resources available to support the
              SRA process, including clinical guides and best practice
              guidelines. On the other hand, effective communication remains
              critical in health care settings. Healthcare teams must maintain
              communication about patient suicide risk as an important part of
              ongoing care (Sadek, 2018), potentially encouraging each other to
              perform and document SRA with competency. As Perlman et al. (2011)
              believes, incorporating mandatory competency-based education and
              training in SRA and the use of each SRA tool is a must for the
              future. Overall, SRA and the inclusion of risk assessment tools
              are utilized in practices today, but further professional
              enhancement is required to understand suicide risk better among
              patients.{" "}
            </p>

            <h2>Commonly Utilized SRA Tools</h2>

            <p>
              Research has illustrated several SRA tools in the mental health
              field, while it is important to note, there is not one prominent
              tool. Instruments may range from screening tools to assessment
              tools (Sadek, 2018). Although some of the most common SRA tools
              share similar attributes. Essentially, the tools tend to focus on
              symptom assessment, warning signs for suicide, and resiliency
              factors (Perlman et al., 2011). As Perlman et al. (2011) states
              these “instruments have been designed for the detection and
              assessment of suicide risk in a variety of settings”.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the other hand, scores from tools are easy to be
              misinterpreted, and Perlman et al. (2011) demands health care
              providers utilizing these tools not be completely reliant on them.
              The idea of scores developed from tools is to gather information
              to help inform clinical decision making about suicide. Tools may
              vary in characteristics, but also to those who perform it. It is
              strongly recommended SRA tools are administered by a professional
              with clinical experience and training, but there are existing SRA
              tools that do not require a professional (CPSI et al., 2021).{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              Scholars have deemed SRA scales as promising, as each assessment
              provides adequate to strong internal consistency (Perlman et al.,
              2011). Some of the common utilized SRA tools established in
              literature, include: the SAD Persons Scale, Beck Hopelessness
              Scale (BHS), SAFE- T and the Sadek Suicide Prevention Assessment
              (SSPA) Tool.
            </p>

            <h3>The SAD Persons Scale.</h3>
            <p>
              This assessment tool utilizes the acronym SAD PERSONS to determine
              the risk of an individual for suicide. The acronym outlines
              potential risk factors, e.g. s – sex, a – age, and d – depression,
              as a guide to understand the suicide risk. While the theory of
              this scale is that the more areas that an individual fit into, the
              higher risk the individual would be considered (CAMH, 2011).
            </p>

            <h3>Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS).</h3>
            <p>
              This scale was often noted in the literature as resourceful. Sadek
              (2018) stated “It was mainly designed to measure negative
              attitudes about one’s future and perceived inability to avert
              negative life events”. The scale has 20 statements that are either
              answered through a true or false measure (e.g. scored 0 or 1).
              Particularly, it measures three aspects of hopelessness including:
              negative feeling about the future, loss of motivation and
              pessimistic expectations (Sadek, 2018). The ratings are then
              summed, as the cut-off score for the BHS is greater than 9. A
              similar scale is referred to as the Beck Scale for Suicide
              Ideation (BSS). This measures the current intensity of attitudes,
              and plans for suicide-related behaviour (Sadek, 2018). BHS is not
              recommended in emergency settings, but BSS would be more
              applicable.{" "}
            </p>

            <h3>SAFE-T.</h3>
            <p>
              The tool SAFE-T is an acronym that stands for Suicide Assessment
              Five-step Evaluation and Triage. It was developed as a
              collaboration between Screening for Mental Health, Inc, and the
              Suicide Prevention Center (CAMH, 2011). The purpose of this tool
              is to identify risk factors and protective risk factors, conduct
              suicide inquiry, determine risk level and document for follow-up.
            </p>

            <h3>Sadek Suicide Prevention Assessment Tool(SSPA).</h3>
            <p>
              Research has showcased this new SRA tool as vital in clinical
              practice. It captures validated risk and protective factors
              related to the mental status of patients during the clinical
              interview, and factors related to the patient profile, in addition
              to areas of risk (Sadek et al., 2020). This tool is different and
              more practical because it has a section for communication which
              can potentially notify other providers involved in the care of the
              patient to be aware of their suicide risk (Sadek et al., 2020).
              SSPA has many unique features that most tools do not. Sadek (2018)
              believes this tool will help in areas of documenting the level of
              the suicide risk (high, moderate, low), understand the reason for
              assessment and to communicate SRA results with other clinicians.
              These are critical when utilizing SRA tools on patients.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              In summary, the SAD Persons Scale, BHS, SAFE- T and Sadek’s
              Suicide Prevention Assessment Tool are commonly known in practice
              and continue to be utilized today. These tools can each shed light
              on a person’s degree of risk of suicide, enabling professionals to
              better support their clients and provide them with the best
              quality of care.
            </p>

            <h2>Choosing an Effective SRA Tool</h2>
            <p>
              As previously discussed, there are a variety of SRA tools that may
              be utilized in practice, and recent literature mentions a
              non-exhaustive list of tools to consider (Sadek, 2018). CPSI et
              al., (2021) specifies that various tools have certain
              characteristics and choosing the most adequate can be complex.
              Prior to choosing a tool, it is important to acknowledge the sole
              purpose of an effective SRA. It is strongly recommended SRA tools
              are not used as a way to predict suicide, but rather to help
              assess and reduce the risk of suicide, inform treatment planning,
              and to promote wellness and recovery through the gathering of
              information (CPSI et al., 2021). Additionally, Perlman et al.
              (2011) outlines the identification of protective factors as an
              essential component of SRA which involves identifying areas of
              strength and resiliency that may be used to ‘buffer suicide risk’.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, choosing an effective SRA tool requires clinical
              judgement, and the hope is that professionals are educated and
              trained, knowing which tool is best to support the patient. As
              Sadek (2018) states, not all patients require the same
              evaluations; SRA can be applied with various degrees of intensity
              depending on the information obtained from the patient and
              collateral sources. Research has focused primarily on factors that
              should be considered when evaluating the suitability of risk
              assessment tools. Technical considerations include correlation,
              reliability, validity, sensitivity, specificity, factor analysis,
              threshold scores, and modes of administration (Perlman et al.,
              2011). Particularly reviewing psychometric properties by gathering
              information on presence of suicide desire, intent, and capability
              (CPSI et al., 2021).
            </p>

            <p>
              Besides the evaluative intent, setting is crucial in the type of
              risk assessment tool utilized to approach an SRA. CPSI et al.
              (2021) examines the rapid changes and new availability of mental
              health services and considers whether SRA may be either effective
              remotely or in-person. Moreover, culture is another factor to
              consider when selecting an SRA tool. Risk assessment gathers
              history of several aspects of an individual’s life, but steers
              away from demographic characteristics. Current history collected
              include risk factors, clinical mental health examinations, and
              collateral sources such as violence towards self or others (Sadek,
              2018). It is critical that specific tools are made available to
              different cultures to fit their particular needs. These tools may
              not only understand different cultural views on health and
              wellness but may recognize that these views can influence motives
              of suicide and related risk or behaviours (CPSI et al., 2021). All
              in all, the goal is for health care professionals to feel
              competent enough in choosing the most effective SRA tool based on
              information gathered on the client, supporting them through
              thoughts of suicidality.
            </p>

            <h2>Different Views on SRA </h2>

            <p>
              There is a significant amount of discussion surrounding SRA tools
              and their viability. Even suicide itself and the ability to
              prevent it from occurring is often up for debate. Some individuals
              believe that suicide is preventable (CPSI et al., 2021) while
              there are others who believe suicide is not always entirely
              preventable (Perlman et al., 2011). This leaves a lot of room for
              conversation surrounding what ‘viable’ means in the case of SRAs.
              There are different SRAs that can be applied in varying
              intensities and in varying situations (Sadek, 2018), giving much
              leeway to different understandings on what the best treatments or
              assessments may be effective. SRAs can be administered in many
              different ways such as self-reports or through clinically
              administered interviews and observations, either orally, with
              pencil and paper, and/or electronically (CPSI et al., 2021).{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              When choosing how to appropriately assess and support service
              users, some health professionals choose to strictly use
              assessments and tools. For instance, the Columbia-Suicide Severity
              Rating Scale and the Suicide Probability Scale (Sadek, 2020) have
              a large amount of empirical research to back them up (Roush et
              al., 2018). Examples of older tools could be the Manchester
              Self-harm Rule and the Repeated Episodes of Self-harm score, which
              used more methodology and are often not strong enough to make a
              clinical decision as they are too based in numerical results.
              Others use tools that are more based in building rapport and
              relationships between the service user and the service provider.
              Some tools that are less based in empirical research include:
              obtaining consent to speak with significant others in the
              patient’s social support network about suicide risk, utilizing
              suicide safety plans (e.g., lists of coping strategies, triggers,
              and support systems), providing contacts with suicide helplines,
              and no-suicide contracts (Roush et al., 2018).

              Some mental health professionals are reluctant to use SRAs,
              worrying that some may be too inaccurate to be useful or that
              focusing on risk management too deeply might lead to defensive
              mechanisms (Oquendo & Bernanke, 2017). SRA tools can also be
              viewed as critical to the assessment process, however they should
              be used to inform clinical judgement rather than replace it (CPSI
              et al., 2021). These assessments, whether rooted in empirical
              research or not, are not the end of all, as it is important
              professionals rely on their own skills to understand the essence
              of another human being; essentially trusting their own personal
              judgement, opposed to relying only on SRAs.
            </p>

            <h2>SRA Benefits and Drawbacks</h2>
            <p>
              SRA’s have definite benefits, as explained throughout this
              literature review. The use of SRAs can assist health care
              providers to assess the risk of a client to take part in suicide
              and can provide documentation on what the SRA included (Sadek,
              2018). There are also many possible drawbacks related to SRA’s.
              Starting at the base level; the beginning, there is the training
              that mental health care providers receive regarding crisis and
              suicide supports or assessments. SRAs require training and the
              understanding that assessment is an ongoing process where the
              risks may change over time (Sadek, 2018). There is concern due to
              the fact health care providers do not receive enough crisis
              training and often feel fear and a lack of confidence (Roush et
              al., 2018) clients avoiding discussing suicide is also the most
              common fear faced by health care providers (Roush et al., 2018).
              This has the potential to negatively affect mental health workers
              when they are making important treatment decisions (Sadek, 2018).
            </p>

            <p>
              Whether knowingly or not, health care providers may have negative
              or anxious views surrounding service users who are suicidal which
              can affect the outcome of treatments (Sadek, 2018). Health care
              providers often rely on subjectively reported information, which
              does not always show the full picture of risk (Sadek, 2018). This
              may be avoided if a health care provider is able to get a more
              complete picture by collecting collateral information about their
              client (Sadek, 2018). It is tricky to find the perfect practice
              because tool guidelines are not all the same in their
              recommendations and there are no universally accepted models
              (Oquendo & Bernanke, 2017). Although SRAs are not perfect and need
              more advancements, they have been valuable when managing and
              supporting suicidal clients. (Oquendo & Bernanke, 2017).

            <h2>Conclusion </h2>

            <p>
              SRAs are essential tools for mental health practitioners to use
              when working with suicidal clients. SRAs come in many different
              models and have various considerations that are necessary and
              important when using these assessments. These tools allow a
              dialogue to be formed between service provider and client and have
              been shown to help lower suicide rates (Sadek, 2018), which is the
              ultimate goal of a mental health professional. More research is
              required, but there are many indications that these tools, if
              utilized properly, are extremely useful for mental health
              professionals.
