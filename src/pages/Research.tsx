              According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2019), an
              approximate 800,000 people die every year due to suicide. Suicide
              risk is common among individuals with underlying mental health
              disorders, and individuals in midst crisis situations that feel
              impotent in dealing with life stressors (WHO, 2019). With increase
              occurrences of suicide, health care providers have incorporated
              suicide risk assessment (SRA) into practice. The American
              Psychiatric Association defines the goal of SRA as “identifying
              factors that may increase or decrease a patient’s level of suicide
              risk, to estimate an overall level of risk, and to develop a care
              plan that addresses their safety and modifiable contributors to
              suicide risk” (Bucago, Cheung, & Zhang, 2019).{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              Besides the significance of SRA, it has a continuous process which
              involves four essential principles. Principles included are: the
              therapeutic relationship, communication and collaboration,
              documentation in the assessment process, and cultural awareness.
              Establishing a therapeutic rapport can improve the SRA process;
              while communication is critical to ensure SRA remains consistent;
              also producing clear notes can help plan for treatments and
              preventative care; and acknowledging culture to be a potential
              influence on suicide (Perlman, Neufeld, Martin, Goy, & Hirdes,
              2011). Altogether these principles guide the assessment process.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              On the other hand, Sadek (2018) also identifies the SRA process in
              three steps. Step one – building a therapeutic relationship and
              alliance with the patients and asking about suicidal ideation. As
              previously mentioned, creating a therapeutic alliance is an
              essential foundation for SRA which involves empathy, support and
              transparency (Sadek, 2018). Additionally, step two – identify risk
              factors, noting those that can be modified to reduce risk. This
              step has the potential to seek risk factors based on the
              information received from the patient and collateral sources such
              as family (Sadek, 2018). Lastly, step three – formulating risk:
              make a clinical judgement of the risk that a patient/client may
              attempt or complete suicide in the short or long term. During this
              step, clinical formulation of risk is considered such as a low
              acute risk, or high chronic risk (Sadek, 2018). Collectively, the
              three steps reflect on the amount of work put into the SRA
              process.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              SRA is primarily conducted in a health care setting. However, this
              assessment should only be conducted if it is a first psychiatric
              admission, and/or the individual is exhibiting suicidal
              behaviour/ideation (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 2011).
              Besides SRA’s being a complex process; it also requires extensive
              knowledge prior to implementing it into practice. Therefore, this
              literature seeks to identify the significance of SRA, current SRA
              in effect, commonly utilized SRA tools, choosing an effective SRA
              tool, the different views on SRA, and SRA benefits and drawbacks.{" "}
            </p>

            <h2>Significance of SRA</h2>
            <p>
              SRA are useful tools for service providers and have been
              identified internationally as a fundamental safety issue among
              health care organizations (Perlman et al., 2011). Throughout
              Canada, suicide is the ninth leading cause of death across all
              ages, with a rate of 10.3 deaths per 100,000 people (Sadek, 2020).
              With this being said, according to the World Health Organization
              (WHO), suicide is one of the top 10 causes of death, and the
              second leading cause of death in people aged 15–29 years (Sadek,
              2018). This illustrates the extreme need for accurate assessment
              by health care professionals. In addition, suicide does not only
              affect the individual who loses their life, but also deeply
              effects peers, friends, family members, coworkers, and overall
              communities (CPSI et al., 2021). Suicides often profoundly affect
              at least 15 people aside from the individual who has passed away
              (CPSI et al., 2021). Besides the long-lasting emotional effects
              left on these other parties, there are also large expenses
              associated with suicide. A mental health commission report in 2016
              explained that the estimated financial cost of a suicide ranges
              from $433,000 to $4,131,000 per individual, depending on potential
              years of life lost, income level, and effects on survivors (Sadek,
              2018).{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              Health care professionals, more specifically mental health care
              providers, have the task of supporting individuals through times
              of poor mental wellness, as well as maintaining positive mental
              health. Roush et al. (2018) references that individuals who lose
              their life from suicide have had contact with a mental health
              professional within one month prior to passing, approximately 20%
              of the time. These professionals are in a key position where they
              are able to appropriately assess suicide risk and make potentially
              life-saving decisions regarding SRA and management, often through
              using SRA tools (Roush et al., 2018). There are often several
              measures that can be taken in order to assist in reducing the risk
              of suicide and suicide attempts (CPSI et al., 2021) and the
              assessment and management of suicide risk is considered a core
              competency for psychiatrists (Oquendo & Bernanke, 2017).{" "}
            </p>

            <h2>Current SRA in Effect</h2>
            <p>
              In current literature, SRA remains an ongoing process that
              involves various tools. SRA tools are significant to the
              assessment process, as it has the advantage to provide additional
              information to inform clinical decision making about suicide (CPSI
              et al., 2021). Typically, the guidelines for SRA are standardized
              in psychiatric facilities. Following the process of screening,
              monitoring, intervention and follow-up to continuously inform
              initial care for progress in treatment and potential changes to
              the level of care (Perlman et al., 2011). To conduct an SRA most
              studies, focus on clinical experience to be an asset. Perlman et
              al. (2011) recommends professionals to understand SRA tools, in
              order to help navigate the SRA process. While, Sadek (2018) and
              Sadek et al. (2020) studies agrees that clinician awareness and
              training should be required to assess for suicide risk, as
              clinical competency is essential for patient care.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although, a substantial amount of research points out the
              inadequacy of SRA implemented into practice. Most concerns are
              about the lack of education and training health care professionals
              have surrounding conducting a SRA (Sadek, 2018). The complexity of
              a SRA can reflect on the quality of care. It is essential changes
              are made to improve the SRA process, to effectively document and
              assist an individual at risk of suicide. Perlman at al. (2011)
              outlines resources available to support the SRA process,
              including, clinical guides and best practice guidelines. On the
              other hand, effective communication remains critical in health
              care settings. Healthcare teams must maintain communication about
              patient suicide risk as an important part of ongoing care (Sadek,
              2018). Potentially encouraging the professional to perform and
              document SRA with competency. As Perlman et al. (2011) believes in
              incorporating mandatory competency-based education and training in
              SRA and the use of each SRA tool for the future. Overall, SRA and
              the inclusion of risk assessment tools are utilized in practices
              today, but further professional enhancement is required to
              understand suicide risk better among patients.{" "}
            </p>

            <h2>Commonly Utilized SRA Tools</h2>

            <p>
              Research has illustrated several SRA tools in the field of
              practice. While it is important to note, there is not one
              prominent tool. Instruments may range from screening tools to
              assessment tools (Sadek, 2018). Although some of the most common
              SRA tools share similar attributes. Essentially, the tools tend to
              focus on symptom assessment, warning signs for suicide, and
              resilience factors (Perlman et al., 2011). As Perlman et al.
              (2011) states “instruments have been designed for the detection
              and assessment of suicide risk in a variety of settings”.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the other hand, scores from tools are easy to be
              misinterpreted. Perlman et al. (2011) demands health care
              providers utilizing these tools to not be completely reliant on
              them. Aforementioned, rather the idea of scores developed from
              tools is to gather information to help inform clinical decision
              making about suicide. Tools may vary in characteristics, but also
              to those who perform it. It is strongly recommended SRA tools are
              administered by a professional with clinical experience and
              training. But, there are existing SRA tools that do not require a
              professional (CPSI et al., 2021).{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              However, evidence has proved most common SRA scales are promising.
              As each provide adequate to strong internal consistency, but also
              are related to other indicators of suicide risk (Perlman et al.,
              2011). With that being said, some of the common utilized SRA tools
              established in literature, include: the SAD Persons Scale, Beck
              Hopelessness Scale (BHS), SAFE- T and the Sadek Suicide Prevention
              Assessment (SSPA) Tool.
            </p>

            <h2>The SAD Persons Scale.</h2>
            <p>
              This assessment tool utilizes the acronym SAD PERSONS as a way to
              determine the risk of an individual for suicide. The acronym
              outlines potential risk factors, e.g. s – sex, a – age, and d –
              depression, as a guide to understand the suicide risk. While the
              theory of this scale is that the more areas that an individual fit
              into, the higher risk the individual would be considered (CAMH,
              2011).
            </p>

            <h2>Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS).</h2>
            <p>
              This scale was often noted in the literature as resourceful. Sadek
              (2018) stated “It was mainly designed to measure negative
              attitudes about one’s future and perceived inability to avert
              negative life events”. The scale has 20 statements that are either
              answered through a true or false measure (e.g. scored 0 or 1).
              Particularly, it measures three aspects of hopelessness including:
              negative feeling about the future, loss of motivation and
              pessimistic expectations (Sadek, 2018). The ratings are then
              summed, as the cut-off score for the BHS is greater than 9. A
              similar scale is referred to as the Beck Scale for Suicide
              Ideation (BSS). This measures the current intensity of attitudes,
              and plans for suicide-related behaviour (Sadek, 2018). BHS is not
              recommended in emergency settings, but BSS would be more
              applicable.{" "}
            </p>

            <h2>SAFE-T.</h2>
            <p>
              The tool SAFE-T is an acronym that stands for Suicide Assessment
              Five-step Evaluation and Triage. It was developed as a
              collaboration between Screening for Mental Health, Inc, and the
              Suicide Prevention Center (CAMH, 2011). The purpose of this tool
              is to identify risk factors and protective risk factors, conduct
              suicide inquiry, determine risk level and document for follow-up.
            </p>

            <h2>Sadek Suicide Prevention Assessment Tool(SSPA).</h2>
            <p>
              Research has outlined this new SRA tool that is vital in
              practices. It captures validated risk and protective factors
              related to the mental status of patients during the clinical
              interview, and factors related to the patient profile, in addition
              to areas of risk (Sadek et al., 2020). This tool is different and
              more practical because it has a section for communication.
              Potentially, it can notify other providers involved in the care of
              the patient to be aware of their suicide risk (Sadek et al.,
              2020). SSPA has many unique features that most tools do not. Sadek
              (2018) believes this tool will help in areas of documenting the
              level of the suicide risk (high, moderate, low), understand the
              reason for assessment and to communicate SRA results with other
              clinicians. These are critical when utilizing SRA tools on
              patients.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              In summary, the SAD Persons Scale, BHS, SAFE- T and Sadek’s
              Suicide Prevention Assessment Tool are commonly known in practice,
              and continue to be utilized today. These tools each in which shed
              light on a person’s degree risk of suicide, enabling professionals
              to better support their patients and provide them with the best
              quality of care.
            </p>

            <h2>Choosing an Effective SRA Tool</h2>
            <p>
              As previously discussed, there are a variety of SRA tools that may
              be utilized in practice. Recent literature mentions a
              non-exhaustive list of tools to consider (Sadek, 2018). As CPSI et
              al., (2021) specifies that various tools have certain
              characteristics and choosing the most adequate one can be complex.
              Prior to choosing a tool, it is significant to acknowledge the
              sole purpose of an effective SRA. It is strongly recommended SRA
              tools to not be used as a way to predict suicide. Rather it helps
              assess and reduce the risk of suicide, inform treatment planning,
              and to promote wellness and recovery through the gathering of
              information (CPSI et al., 2021). Additionally, Perlman et al.
              (2011) outlines the identification of protective factors as an
              essential component of SRA, potentially identifying strengths and
              resiliency that may be used to ‘buffer suicide risk’.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, choosing an effective SRA tool initiates with
              clinical judgement. With the expectation professionals are
              educated and trained, they know which tool is best to support the
              patient. As Sadek (2018) states, not all patients require the same
              evaluations; SRA can be applied with various degrees of intensity
              depending on the information obtained from the patient and
              collateral sources. This being said, research focused primarily on
              factors that should be considered when evaluating the suitability
              of risk assessment tools. Technical considerations include:
              correlation, reliability, validity, sensitivity, specificity,
              factor analysis, threshold scores, modes of administration
              (Perlman et al., 2011). Particularly reviewing psychometric
              properties by gathering information on presence of suicide desire,
              intent and capability (CPSI et al., 2021).
            </p>

            <p>
              Besides the evaluative intent, setting is crucial in the type of
              risk assessment tool utilized to approach an SRA. CPSI et al.
              (2021) examines with rapid changes and new availability of mental
              health services, SRA may be either effective remotely or
              in-person. Moreover, culture is another factor to consider when
              selecting a SRA tool. Risk assessment gathers history of several
              aspects of an individual’s life, but steers away from demographic
              characteristics. Current history collected include risk factors,
              clinical mental health status examinations, and collateral sources
              such as violence towards self or others (Sadek, 2018). It is
              critical specific tools are made available to different cultures
              to fit their particular needs. These tools may not only understand
              different cultures views on health or wellness, but may recognize
              that these different cultures views may influence motives of
              suicide related risk or behaviours (CPSI et al., 2021). All in
              all, the goal is for health care professionals to feel competent
              enough in choosing the most effective SRA tool based on
              information gathered on the patient; supporting them through
              suicidality.
            </p>

            <h2>Different Views on SRA </h2>

            <p>
              There is a significant amount of discussion surrounding SRA tools
              and their viability. Even suicide itself and the ability to
              prevent it from occurring is often up for debate. Some individuals
              believe that suicide is preventable (CPSI et al., 2021) while
              there are others who believe that suicide is not always entirely
              preventable (Perlman et al., 2011). This leaves a lot of room for
              conversation surrounding what ‘viable’ means in the case of SRA’s.
              There are different SRA’s that can be applied in varying
              intensities and in varying situations (Sadek, 2018), giving much
              leeway to different understandings on what the best treatments or
              assessments may be effective. SRA’s can be administered in many
              different ways such as self-reports or through clinically
              administered interviews and observations, either orally, with
              pencil and paper, and/or electronically (CPSI et al., 2021).{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              When choosing how to appropriately assess and support service
              users, some health professionals choose to strictly use
              assessments and tools. For instance, the Columbia-Suicide Severity
              Rating Scale and the Suicide Probability Scale (Sadek, 2020) have
              a large amount of empirical research to back them up (Roush et
              al., 2018). Examples of older tools could be the Manchester
              Self-harm Rule and the Repeated Episodes of Self-harm score, which
              used more methodology and are often not strong enough to make a
              clinical decision as they are too based in numerical results.
              Others use tools that are more based in building rapport and
              relationships between the service user and the service provider.
              Some tools that are less based in empirical research include:
              obtaining consent to speak with significant others in the
              patient’s social support network about suicide risk, utilizing
              suicide safety plans (e.g. lists of coping strategies, triggers,
              and support systems), providing contacts with suicide helplines,
              and no-suicide contracts (Roush et al., 2018).

              Some mental health professionals are reluctant to use SRA’s,
              worrying that some may be too inaccurate to be useful or that
              focusing on risk management too deeply might lead to defensive
              medicine (Oquendo & Bernanke, 2017). SRA’s can also be viewed as
              critical to the assessment process. However, they should be used
              to inform clinical judgement rather than replace it (CPSI et al.,
              2021). These assessments, whether rooted in empirical research or
              not, are not the end of all, as it is important professionals rely
              on their own skills to understand the essence of another human
              being; essentially trusting their own personal judgement, opposed
              to relying only on SRA’s.

            <h2>SRA Benefits and Drawbacks</h2>
            <p>
              SRA’s have definite benefits, as explained throughout this
              literature review. The use of SRA’s can assist health care
              providers to assess the risk a service user has to take part in
              suicide and can provide documentation on what the SRA consisted of
              (Sadek, 2018). However, there are also many possible drawbacks
              related to SRA’s. Starting at the base level; the beginning, there
              is the training that mental health care providers receive
              regarding crisis and suicide supports or assessments. SRA’s
              require training and the understanding that assessment is an
              ongoing process where the risks may change over time (Sadek,
              2018). There is sudden concern because health care providers do
              not receive enough crisis training and often feel fear and a lack
              of confidence (Roush et al., 2018). Service users passing by
              suicide is also the most common fears faced by health care
              providers (Roush et al., 2018). This can often negatively affect
              mental health workers when they are making treatment decisions
              (Sadek, 2018).
            </p>

            <p>
              Whether knowingly or not, health care providers may have negative
              or anxious views surrounding service users who are suicidal which
              can affect the outcome of treatments (Sadek, 2018). Health care
              providers often rely on subjectively reported information, which
              does not always show the full picture of risk (Sadek, 2018). This
              can be minorly avoided if a health care provider can get a more
              complete picture by collecting collateral information about the
              service user (Sadek, 2018). It is tricky to find the perfect
              practices because tool guidelines are not all the same in their
              recommendations and there are no universally accepted models
              (Oquendo & Bernanke, 2017). Although SRA’s are not perfect and
              need more advancements, they have aided in managing and supporting
              suicidal service users (Oquendo & Bernanke, 2017).

            <h2>Conclusion </h2>

            <p>
              Suicide risk assessments are essential tools for health care
              workers. SRA’s come in many different varieties and have various
              considerations that are necessary when using these assessments.
              But these tools allow a dialogue to be created between service
              provider and service user and can overall help with lowering
              suicide rates (Sadek, 2018), which ultimately is a goal of mental
              health professionals. More research is needed but there are many
              signs that these tools, if utilized properly, are extremely
              helpful for mental health professionals.
